# Failure-Pattern-in-Concrete-Cylinder-
This project involves studying the failure patterns in a concrete cylinder of diameter 150 mm and variable height (300 mm, 600 mm, 1000 mm) loaded in unconfined compression by stiff as well as flexible plattens. An axisymmetric finite element model is created for cylinder in abaqus. Concrete material is modelled using Concrete Damaged Plasticity model.
